# Indian_Sign_Language_Recognition
Static and dynamic Indian Sign Language recognition systems enhance communication for the hearing-impaired. Static recognition uses single images to interpret stationary hand gestures like letters or numbers. Dynamic recognition processes video sequences to capture gestures involving movement, allowing interpretation of complex words or sentences.
